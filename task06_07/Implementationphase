Here is the wireframe and design . I have implemented on the same 
It's just an overview how after completing letterboxd may look like
In this both are there for mobile view and for desktop view


For mobile view , I created the wirefframe and added styles too in the same file . When we run it we will be able to see the implementation of the letterboxd in mobile view.
This is the raw design only ,Once I decide to work on this figma design fully , many changes will be there just like imdb website with proper cloning and little bit of design changes .

For website view, I added the styles . But here as website is too big to handle , there will be changes here too. Like when you will click on Kai po che movie , it will take you to that film. It is also a raw design with proper designs to be taken care of.
