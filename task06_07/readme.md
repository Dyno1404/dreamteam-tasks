WIREFRAME THE SKELETON
Wireframes serve as the skeletons for designs, acting as blueprints for the design and development phases. They provide clarity and direction for the project, laying the groundwork upon which the designs are built.
Figma Design Task
This phase is where your project starts to feel real, as you add color, style, and interactions that make the design engaging and user-friendly. Begin with the website (desktop view); once you're satisfied with how it looks, adapt the design for mobile.
