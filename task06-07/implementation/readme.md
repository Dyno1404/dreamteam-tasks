For Task 06 and Task 07, I created wireframes and designed both the mobile and desktop views of the Letterboxd-inspired project using Figma. In the mobile view, I designed the wireframe and added styles, making it responsive and interactive. This is a raw design, with plans for further refinement, including features like IMDb-style cloning and design adjustments. For the website view, I implemented basic styling, but there will be changes, such as clickable movie links that redirect to their respective pages. Both designs lay the foundation for a polished, user-friendly platform that will evolve as development progresses.
