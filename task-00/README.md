Why linux?
Ans-Open source: Linux's source code is accessible to anyone, which means not only can it be reviewed by the public, but there is also a large community ready to provide support when issues arise. Additionally, Linux is more secure compared to other closed-source operating systems.
Ease of development: Programming and development, in general, are significantly enhanced on Linux compared to other OSes.
Hands-on learning: Using Linux encourages a deeper understanding of how an operating system works under the hood, offering a valuable learning experience.
