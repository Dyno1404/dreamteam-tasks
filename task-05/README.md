The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document created for the Letterboxd-inspired project serves as a foundational guide to the development of the platform. It outlines the core features and functional requirements needed for the website, providing a clear understanding of the project's objectives. This document is essential for aligning the development team, designers, and stakeholders on the projectâ€™s goals and scope.

For this task, the SRS document includes key elements such as user authentication (sign-up, sign-in, and social media login), search functionality, task/item addition, a review and rating system, watchlists, social features, recommendations, and curated lists. These features ensure the platform enables users to discover, rate, and review films while interacting with other users. 

The SRS document also covers design guidelines, user needs, and the overall structure of the platform. It highlights the importance of creating a user-friendly interface, clean code, and ensuring that all functionalities work seamlessly together. By defining the requirements clearly, the document helps streamline the development process and ensures that all essential features are implemented effectively.

This SRS document is an important milestone in the project, providing a blueprint that will guide the development of the Letterboxd-inspired platform. It will be referred to throughout the development cycle to ensure the project stays aligned with its goals and meets user expectations.
