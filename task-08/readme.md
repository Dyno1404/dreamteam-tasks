In Task 08, I focused on the frontend development of the Letterboxd-inspired project using Next.js, a popular React framework. The goal was to create a functional and user-friendly interface while ensuring scalability, performance, and ease of future backend integration.

I started by implementing the header section, which includes important site navigation elements such as the logo, links to different pages, and the dark mode toggle. The dark mode feature enhances user experience by providing a visually comfortable interface, especially for extended viewing. I also added the About page, which provides basic information about the platform, offering users a brief overview of the site’s purpose and features.

For navigation, I created a reusable Navbar component that handles site-wide links, such as home, movies, and user-related actions. This Navbar ensures consistent navigation throughout the application, offering an intuitive layout. The card component was implemented to display each movie, providing necessary details such as the movie's title, description, and rating. The card layout is dynamic, and it allows for the efficient display of various movie details in a visually appealing format.

The Movie page is designed to display more detailed information about individual films, including ratings, reviews, and the option to add the movie to the user’s watchlist. This page is built to be flexible, allowing it to dynamically accommodate different movie data when the backend integration is completed.

A key feature of the project is the search box, which allows users to search for movies based on various parameters like title, genre, or rating. While the frontend design for this feature is complete, I was unable to fetch data from the API at this stage. However, I ensured that the search functionality is set up to accept user input and trigger a search query once the backend is integrated.

For styling, I used Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that speeds up development by providing predefined classes for various design elements. This allowed me to focus on layout and design without worrying about writing custom CSS from scratch. Tailwind CSS integrates seamlessly with Next.js and helps maintain a consistent look and feel across the website.

The frontend structure is designed to be flexible and modular. Components like the Navbar, Movie cards, and Search box are reusable, and their individual responsibilities are clearly defined. This modular approach will be extremely helpful when connecting the frontend to the backend, as it allows for easier maintenance and updates. The overall design ensures that the website is scalable and can accommodate future features, such as user-generated content, recommendations, and community engagement tools.


I was able to implement a clean, functional frontend that aligns with the overall vision of the Letterboxd-inspired platform. The layout is simple, but it's designed to grow and evolve as new features and data are added. The dark mode toggle, search functionality, and navigation components are all well-integrated into the overall user experience, setting the stage for future development.

In conclusion, this task provided valuable experience in frontend development using Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS. The skills I gained in structuring a frontend, implementing reusable components, and preparing for backend integration will be crucial as I continue to develop the Letterboxd-inspired platform. The work I’ve done so far ensures that the website is ready to integrate dynamic data and scale with future features. The modular approach I’ve used makes the frontend both flexible and easy to maintain, paving the way for a seamless transition to the next stages of development.
